        <h6><u>Why should one give</u></h6>
        <p>One of life’s fundamental law is "Every single act of love, kindness and generosity will multiply and return to you many times over." The Act or better stated as the ‘Art of Giving’ can simply be defined as giving truly from the heart without any expectations of receiving something in return. Giving does not have its rules or limits; nor does it have anything to do with societal pressure or any standards set by people. 
            The intention behind your offering is the most essential thing. True giving comes out of kindness and selflessness. When the intention of the giver and receiver are right, it creates an astonishing pattern of joy, love and happiness beyond what you could ever expect. Giving has various forms and depends entirely on the giver. Volunteering, performing good deeds, donation of used items, gifting homemade elements are few amongst the common ones.
            Philanthropy in India is as ancient as the country itself. India’s population embraces all of the world’s major religions, which has helped shape the pattern of its charitable giving. Being a developing nation; the onus of helping the poor was initially not solely on the government. As a result, many Indians initiated informally giving those in need and extending their helping hands for a good cause. 
            In the 19th and early 20th centuries more organised forms of giving began to appear. In 1860, under the British Raj, the Societies Registration Act was passed, allowing the registration of entities generally involved in the benefit of society – education, health, employment etc. The Sir Ratan Tata Trust, one of the country’s first grant-making public foundations, was established in 1919. Other family foundations – including the Godrej, Birla and Bajaj foundations – were set up before the country’s independence in 1947. A relaxation of tax levels since the 1990s, together with an economic boom, laid the foundations for the growth in Indian philanthropy over the past two decades. 62% of all foundations in India have been founded since 1990.
            Put simply, humans have thrived because — unlike nearly all other animals, we can come together to form large, interdependent groups of unrelated members. There is strength in numbers. It is arguable that we would never have been able to form the tribes and later the societies that are the building blocks of prosperous civilizations if helping other people didn’t feel good. Giving is a unique power we all possess that creates synergy in the world. It is great for the giver, but beyond that, it impacts and touches the lives of others, creating a catalyst for good. Any act of altruism secretes ‘feel good’ chemicals in the body. Studies show that providing for others boosts our confidence and releases serotonin and dopamine in our brain. 
            Charitable giving improves quality of life by simply changing your outlook to recognize your privileges, and how you can help the less fortunate. Simply put, it improves health to give, whether that means financial donations or with acts of service to people in need. The more you give, the more you serve, the more it becomes second nature.
            “It’s easier to take than to give. It’s nobler to give than to take. The thrill of taking lasts a day. The thrill of giving lasts a lifetime.” - Joan Marques
